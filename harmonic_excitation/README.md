# Harmonic Excitation
## Harmonic Excitation with Linear and Nonlinear Models


### Problem Statement
Harmonic excitation is very common in vibrating systems. More complex excitation can be considered as summation of multiple harmonic excitations.

An electronics module is mounted on a machine and is modeled as an SDOF spring-mass-damper system. The module is subject to a harmonic forces F<sub>01</sub> = 50 N at w<sub>1</sub> = 3 rad/s and F<sub>02</sub> = 25 N at w<sub>2</sub> = 6 rad/s. Assume the following parameters: m =75 kg, K = 250 N/m, c = 8 kg/s. Assume the initial conditions of the system are x0 = 0.01 m and v0 = 0.5 m/s. The moduleâ€™s amplitude of vibration must be less than 0.4 m,  and its speed must be under 0.8 m/s, both even during the transient stage.

This lab has parts a, b, and c.
